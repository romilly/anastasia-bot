# Bill of Materials

## Anastasia and Controller

**Notes**

1. *Generic* is my shorthand for *available from lots of places - any will do!* 
1. The Caster and Brackets come with their own mounting screws, so you'll see them in the build images but not in the BOM.
1. Alternative motors are widely available, but you'll need to check a few things.
    1. Make sure the motors are described as *TT motors*.
    1. Make sure the motors can run off 3-6 volts. Some appear to be 3v only; these might burn out.
    1. Make sure the motors will fit the Motor brackets. Some have a large raised pillar around their shaft.
    1. Make sure the size and shape of the motor shaft matches the wheels you get.
    1. If you don't want to do any soldering, make sure the motors have wires attached.
