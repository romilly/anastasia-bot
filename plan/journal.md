# Project journal for Anastasia

## Saturday 07 March 2020

I started the robot and blogged about it.

## Sunday 08 March 2020

I tried out a radio-based micro:bit controller

## Monday 09 March 2020

I'm sharing the project on GitHub.

## Tuesday 10 March 2020

I've coded the controller and Anasatsia's code.

I've posted the controller code on RAReblog, and will post Anastaisai's code tomrorrow.

## Monday 16 March 2020

A lot of work done; journal updates, not so much :)

I've posted all the code, listed a Bill of Materials, and taken pictures of the build.
